Holding Repo for stuff while I learn React.js

To avoid strife with trying to install npm and nodejs, there's a very useful tool you can use:

FNM - Fast and Simple Node Manager
==================================
The fast and simple Node manager is just that: fast and simple!

Grab it here - https://github.com/Schniz/fnm

Example commands: 

fnm list-remote (see all remote versions of node available)

fnm install XX.yy (where X and Y are major and minor versions)
